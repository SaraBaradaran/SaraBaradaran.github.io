I have recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology. Now I am a Teaching Assistant at the Isfahan University of Technology in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I am interested in program analysis and verification. I research machine learning techniques that can be employed to solve various problems and improve the accuracy and time efficiency of program analysis approaches.

I am highly motivated to collaborate with people who work on the above research areas.
