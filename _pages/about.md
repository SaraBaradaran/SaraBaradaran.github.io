I have recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the Isfahan University of Technology. Now I am a teaching assistant at the Isfahan University of Technology in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. I like to teach my knowledge to others and this is very enjoyable for me.

### My Reesearch
I am interested in program analysis and verification. I researched machine learning techniques that can be employed to improve the accuracy and time efficiency of program analysis approaches.

I am motivated to collaborate with people who work on the above research areas.
